/* Function that takes a char * which is a buffer of data received. This 
 * buffer contains 1 or MESSAGES where a message is defined as being a 
 * series of characters ending in a newline. Its other parameter, end,
 * is the length of the first message in the buffer. If MESSAGES contains more 
 * than one message then these messages WILL NOT be separated by a null
 * terminator. However, MESSAGES will always be terminated by a null 
 * terminator. The function should malloc and outputs a new char * consisting 
 * of the first message (which needs end + 1 Bytes). It should also update 
 * MESSAGES so that its contents are a string that contains any remaining 
 * messages and just a null terminator if no more messages remain. You may 
 * want to use some combination of strlen, strcpy, and strncpy. As an 
 * important note if you elect to attempt to use strcpy or strncpy for this 
 * function the dst pointer and the src pointer cannot contain addresses that 
 * will overlap. This means the address of any information from src cannot be 
 * the same as an address that gets written to in dst */
